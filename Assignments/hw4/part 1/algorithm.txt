Input Reading:

    Read the student data from a CSV file and parse the data into appropriate data structures.

    Steps:
        Open the CSV file.
        Parse each line into a Student struct.
        Store the Student struct in a vector.

    Code Implementation:

        Function: read_students_results(const string &file_name, vector<Student> &students)
            Open the file.
            Parse each line and fill the Student struct fields.
            Add the Student struct to the students vector.

Data Structures:

    Student Struct:
        Fields:
        username
        programming
        debugging
        algorithm
        do_not_work_with
        prefer_to_work_with
    Justification: Encapsulates all data per line in one object.

    Vector of Students:
        vector<Student> students
        Justification: Efficiently stores and manages student data dynamically.

    Map for Student Preferences:
        map<string, Student> student_map
        Justification: Allows quick access to a student and their preferences and constraints.

Forming Teams:

    Form teams based on user-specified criteria (either by student preferences or by balancing skills).
    Steps:
        Prompt the user for the team size.
        Prompt the user for the team formation strategy (preferences or skills).
        Implement a function to form teams based on the chosen strategy.
        Use a greedy approach to assign students to teams while honoring constraints.

    Code Implementation:

        Function: create_teams(vector<Student> &students, int team_size, map<int, vector<Student>> &teams, string preference)
            Preference "L":
                Categorize students by skill levels.
                Use a priority map to determine the order of skill levels added to teams.
                Form teams ensuring each team is skill-balanced.
            Preference "P":
                Map students to their preferred teammates.
                Form teams ensuring each team honors student preferences as much as possible.

Score Calculation:

    Calculate and display each team's score based on their skills.
    Steps:
        Iterate 
        Sum up their skills.
        Display the scores and team composition neatly.

    Code Implementation:

        print_teams(map<int, vector<Student>> &teams)
            Calculate scores for programming, debugging, and design.
            Print team composition and scores.
