Welcome to our Airline Reservation System!

As a passenger, you can easily access the system without any login credentials and enjoy various features, such as:

- View the Seating Chart: See the available seats on your flight.
- Pick a Random Seat: Let the system choose a seat for you.
- Pick a Seat Manually: Select your preferred seat.
- Change or Cancel Your Seat: Modify your seat selection or cancel your reservation.
- Print Your Boarding Pass: Get your boarding pass ready for your journey.
- Quit the Program

For employees, secure access is required with the following credentials:

Username: `Aaryan`
Password: `Aaryan`

As an employee, you have additional capabilities:

- Display the Seating Map: View the updated seating chart based on the passenger manifest.
- Print the Passenger Manifest: Generate a report of all passengers and their seat details.
- Sort the Manifest: Order the manifest by seat number, passenger name, or seat class.
- Load Previous Seat Assignments: Retrieve seat assignments from previous sessions (saved_manifest.txt).
- Save Current Seat Assignments: Save the current seat assignments (from the working_manifest to the saved_manifest).
- Reassign or Cancel a Seat: Modify or cancel a passengerâ€™s seat.
- Quit the Program: Exit the Program securely.

Things to note:

- To start, the program already has Aaryan Jain as a passenger in seat A1 in the `working_manifest` and `saved_manifest`
- Every time the program starts, it will read all the users from the `saved_manifest` and be populated through that
- As a passenger, after every change to the seating chart, the working manifest will be updated.

We hope you find my Airline Reservation System user-friendly and efficient. Safe travels!
