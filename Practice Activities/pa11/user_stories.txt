The system will store detailed information about members, including their names, 
membership types, email addresses, physical addresses, and interests. 
Additionally, it will track their participation and performance in the different sports. 
The goal is to create a user-friendly platform for both the athletics department and students.


These are some user stories that we will keep in mind when designing our system:

As an athletics department staff member, I want to register new members by entering 
their personal information and membership type so that they can participate in intramural sports.

As a member, I want to update my personal information and interests, 
so that I receive relevant updates about sports and events.

As a coach, I want to track the performance of my team members in various sports activities, 
so I can analyze their progress and plan training sessions accordingly.

As an administrator, I want to generate reports on member participation and performance, 
so I can evaluate the effectiveness of the intramural sports program.
